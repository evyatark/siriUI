            <p>Sometimes it does not find the relevant data about stops in GTFS (probably because the trip IDs of Siri are different from the trip IDs in GTFS.</p>
            <p>In that case, GTFS contains wrong trip IDs. Siri has the correct trip IDs.</p>
            <p>It seems that "stops" and "stopTimeData" contain the same information. In "stops" it is arranged as a feature collection.
            Do we calculate twice, or do we build the second from the first?
